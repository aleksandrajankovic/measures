											<h3>Prevention of problems in betting</h3>
										<p>Here are our recommendations of principles to follow so that you can enjoy gaming responsibly:<br>
											Betting is for fun, not a way of earning money.<br>
											Make sure you play only when relaxed and concentrated.<br>
											Take regular breaks.<br>
											Decide your monthly betting stake in advance. Independently of our standard deposit limits, you may set a lower amount as your own personal limit.<br>
											Do not increase the maximum limit which you have decided for yourself.<br>
											Before you start betting, decide the winning amount at which you will end the game.<br>
											Decide beforehand how high your losses can be.<br>
											Never play under the influence of alcohol or other substances.<br>
											Never play when depressed.<br>
											</p>
										<h3>Reality check</h3>
										<p>Set yourself time limit before you start betting and stick to it by setting an alarm.<br> We strongly advise that you keep your device clock enabled whilst betting so you can easily refer to it.<br> This is the way to remind yourself how long you have been on line may be to utilize an online stop watch or timer to give an indicator when a certain time period has elapsed.</p>
										<h3>Player protection</h3>
										<p>Advice for recognizing problematic behavior:<br>
											Problematic behavior in betting is defined as behavior that damages the existence, work or financial situation of an individual or family. Long term betting is certainly not suitable for the individuals’ personal situation and could have a negative overall impact on person’s well-being.<br>
											The most dangerous overall impact is the psychological illness of pathological betting. This condition has to be treated seriously. Prolonged intervals of betting and betting can lead to addiction problems.
											</p>
										<h3><u>HOW TO RECOGNIZE PROBLEMATIC BEHAVIOR?</u></h3>
										<p class="text-1">We would like to present certain parameters that can be warning signs or signals that can be considered as indicative for addiction problems or problematic behavior:</p>
									
										<ul class="list">
											<li>The player is heavily involved in betting. Their thoughts constantly turn to betting.</li>
											<li>The stakes wagered become higher and higher.</li>
											<li>Attempts to control/give up betting are unsuccessful.</li>
											<li>The player becomes irritated and frustrated after attempting to reduce the extent of betting.</li>
											<li>Betting serves as a means of getting away from problems or unpleasant feelings.</li>
											<li>The player is trying to regain losses.</li>
											<li>The player lies about his betting behavior.</li>
											<li>The player acts illegally.</li>
											<li>The player damages or loses other relationships or his job.</li>
											<li>The player relies on others to give him money.</li>
										</ul>
